      How do firms in global value chains react to input shortages? We examine micro-level adjustments to supply chain shocks, building on the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. French firms sourcing inputs from China just before the early lockdown in the country experienced a relative drop in imports that increases from February to April 2020. This shock on input purchases transmits to the rest of the supply chain through exposed firms' domestic and export sales. Between February and June, firms exposed to the Chinese early lockdown experienced a 5.5% drop in domestic sales and a 5% drop in exports, in relative terms with respect to comparable non-exposed firms. The drop in foreign sales is entirely attributable to a lower volume of exports driven by a temporary withdrawal from occasional markets. We then dig into the heterogeneity of the transmission across treated firms. Whereas the ex-ante geographic diversification of inputs does not seem to mitigate the impact of the shock, firms with relatively high inventories have been able to absorb the supply shock better.

      Ambient density --- the number of people in a given area at a given time --- is often hypothesized to be an important determinant of urban safety. However, there has been limited empirical evidence to support this claim due to the difficulty of measuring the movement of ordinary citizens. With smartphone location data, we measure ambient density in Chicago neighborhoods and estimate its effect on crime rates. Using a shift-share instrument and temporary transit station closures for identification, we show that crime rates fall when ambient density increases. We find that the beneficial effects of density are strongest in low and medium-density neighborhoods, which suggests that policies spreading people over space are likely to reduce crime. Finally, we show how the development of work-from-home is likely to affect crime rates in different neighborhoods of Chicago.

      We use micro-level price data underlying the French producer price index from January 2018 to July 2022, along with external measures of firms' exposure to imported inputs and energy cost shocks, to study the role of external shocks in the recent inflation surge. Within our sample, firms pass through 30% of changes in the price of imported inputs and 100% of changes in energy costs when resetting their prices, conditional on their exposure to these shocks. For the average firm in our data, this implies that a 10% increase in foreign costs leads to a 0.74% rise in output prices, while a 10% energy cost shock induces prices to increase by 0.73%. We examine how pass-through rates vary across firms within and across industries, depending on their size and exposure to shocks. We find that pass-through rates are asymmetric, with positive cost shocks inducing significantly more pass-through than negative shocks. The heterogeneity in exposure to external shocks across firms and sectors drives important differences in inflation dynamics along firms' distribution. To illustrate this, we predict price changes from cumulative imported inputs and energy price changes between January 2021 and July 2022, and find that between 70% and 75% of the variance in predicted price changes happens within 2-digit industries, across firms. The chemical and metal industries are the most impacted by both imported and energy cost shocks, which contribute to an increase in producer prices in those sectors of at least 9% to 14%.
