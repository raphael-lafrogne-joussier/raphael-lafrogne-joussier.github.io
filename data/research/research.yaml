      How do firms in global value chains react to input shortages? We examine micro-level adjustments to supply chain shocks, building on the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. French firms sourcing inputs from China just before the early lockdown in the country experienced a relative drop in imports that increases from February to April 2020. This shock on input purchases transmits to the rest of the supply chain through exposed firms' domestic and export sales. Between February and June, firms exposed to the Chinese early lockdown experienced a 5.5% drop in domestic sales and a 5% drop in exports, in relative terms with respect to comparable non-exposed firms. The drop in foreign sales is entirely attributable to a lower volume of exports driven by a temporary withdrawal from occasional markets. We then dig into the heterogeneity of the transmission across treated firms. Whereas the ex-ante geographic diversification of inputs does not seem to mitigate the impact of the shock, firms with relatively high inventories have been able to absorb the supply shock better.

      People flows are often hypothesized to be an important determinant of urban safety. However, there has been limited empirical evidence to support this claim due to the difficulty of measuring the movement of ordinary citizens. With smartphone location data, we measure people flows in Chicago and estimate their effect on crime rates. Using a shift-share instrument and temporary transit station closures for identification, we show that crime rates fall when ambient density (the number of people per sq. ft at a given time) increases. We find that the beneficial effects of density are strongest in low and medium-density neighborhoods, which suggests that policies spreading people flows over space are likely to reduce crime. Finally, we show how the development of work from home is likely to affect crime rates in different neighborhoods of Chicago.

      We use micro-level price data underlying the French producer price index to study the pricing behavior of manufacturing firms between January 2018 and July 2022, and the role of external shocks in the recent surge in inflation. Using the micro price data and external measures of firms' exposure to imported inputs and energy cost shocks, we estimate the pass-through of external cost shocks to producer prices.
