      How do firms in global value chains react to input shortages? We examine micro-level adjustments to supply chain shocks, building on the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. French firms sourcing inputs from China just before the early lockdown in the country experienced a relative drop in imports that increases from February to April 2020. This shock on input purchases transmits to the rest of the supply chain through exposed firms' domestic and export sales. Between February and June, firms exposed to the Chinese early lockdown experienced a 5.5% drop in domestic sales and a 5% drop in exports, in relative terms with respect to comparable non-exposed firms. The drop in foreign sales is entirely attributable to a lower volume of exports driven by a temporary withdrawal from occasional markets. We then dig into the heterogeneity of the transmission across treated firms. Whereas the ex-ante geographic diversification of inputs does not seem to mitigate the impact of the shock, firms with relatively high inventories have been able to absorb the supply shock better.

      While people flows are often hypothesized to be an important determinant of urban safety, there has been limited empirical evidence to support this claim due to the difficulty of precisely measure the movements of ordinary citizens. With smartphone location data, we measure people flows in Chicago and estimate their effect on crime rates. Using a shift-share instrument and temporary transit station closures for identification, we show that crime rates fall when ambient density -- the number of people per sq. ft at a given time --  increases. We study whether policies that spread people flows over space are likely to reduce crime, and estimate how the development of work from home is likely to affect crime rates in different neighborhoods of Chicago.

      We leverage product-level monthly price data to estimate imported costs and energy costs pass-through. We study the price setting behavior during the high inflation since 2021 and the role of big firms in inflation.
