I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [CREST](https://crest.science/)-[Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) ([IP Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en)), under the supervision of [Isabelle Mejean](https://www.isabellemejean.com/).

I study **global value chains**, **urban** and **spatial** economics.

<!--- I received a BSc in mathematics and economics from Ecole Polytechnique in 2019, a MRes in Economics from IP Paris and a Statistician/Economist MSc degree from [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/) in 2020. From some parallel life, I also hold a BA in Philosophy. --->


Here are my [CV](https://raphael-lafrogne-joussier.github.io/homepage/CV_academic.pdf) and my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dt7xJSYAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am currently working as a macroeconomist at the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies ([Insee](https://www.insee.fr/)).
