Welcome!

I am an applied trade economist studying **risk in global value chains**. I am also interested in **urban** and **environmental** topics. I will be visiting [Princeton University](https://economics.princeton.edu) during April 2025.

I received my PhD in Economics from [CREST](https://crest.science/)-[Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) ([IP Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en)), under the supervision of [Isabelle Mejean](https://www.isabellemejean.com/). I visited [Columbia University](https://econ.columbia.edu/) during Spring 2024. 


I am currently working as a micro-to-macro economist at the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies ([Insee](https://www.insee.fr/)).	

<!--- I received a BSc in mathematics and economics from Ecole Polytechnique in 2019, a MRes in Economics from IP Paris and a Statistician/Economist MSc degree from [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/) in 2020. From some parallel life, I also hold a BA in Philosophy. --->
